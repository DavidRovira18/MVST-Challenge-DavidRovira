It is a web tool that lets you search for a GitHub user and show its repositories and other user info.

This project was done using React and Typescript. The only extra library used is styled components for simplicity of the code.

It was a challenging project since I had never used React nor Typescript and I had to understand and apply concepts that I never done 
before. I think the thing that it is very improvable is the styling of the repositories info. If I had more time to focus on that the project would have a more appealing style.

Thanks for the oportunity and I hope you appreciate the effort of doing this with no React or Typescript knowledge.
